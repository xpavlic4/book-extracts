## Week 5
Speed of light is 300 000 km/s, or 1 foot pre nanosecond
Light year = distance covered by light in one year

## Week 8
# Einstein in context
  * worked in Swiss pattern office
  * 1905 was his miracle year, several papers
  * "time is suspect"

# Principle of relativity, principle of light constancy
  * invariance  of the speed of light to all observers

# Relativity of simultaneity
 * clocks that are synchronized in static frame of reference are not synchronized in moving frame of reference
 * time dilation - someone who observers moving clock will see moving clock move more slowly than theirs
 * length contraction
 * Lorenz transformation between inertial frames of reference

# Implication
## Faster than light
reversal of cause and effect
