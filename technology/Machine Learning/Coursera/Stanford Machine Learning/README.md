# Introduction, Regression Analysis, and Gradient Descent

Applications of machine learning include
* Search
* Photo tagging
* Spam filters

Examples:
 * Applications that cannot be programmed by hand
  * Autonomous helicopter
  * Handwriting recognition

Definition

Machine learning: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"

Several types of learning algorithms
* Supervised learning

    Teach the computer how to do something, then let it use it;s new found knowledge to do it
* Unsupervised learning

  Let the computer learn how to do something, and use this to determine structure and patterns in data
* Reinforcement learning
* Recommender systems

## Supervised learning

How do we predict prices of houses?

Problem: How to estimate 750 squere feet price?

Straight line or polynomial? This type of problem is regression problem - predict continuous valued output.

Problem finding whether cancer is malignant or benign based on tumor size:
Classification problem - you have discrete classes

For multi-dimension

## Unsupervised learning
* In unsupervised learning, we get unlabeled data

### Clustering algorithm
Example Google news
 * Groups news stories into cohesive groups

### Cocktail party algorithm

 Lots of overlapping voices - hard to hear what everyone is saying

Two people talking, microphones at different distances from speakers

 The problem is to seperate two clean sources of speakers. Easy to do in MATLAB or Octave.

## Linear Regression
