## Mobile app Analysis

The use of a set of combined tools (like Apktool, Dex2Jar, and JD-GUI for Android or Clutch in conjunction with IPA or a Hopper disassembler for iOS) will allow an attacker to extract the source code from any mobile app binary for further analysis using a tool like TruffleHog to identify all secrets in the source code. With a proxy tool like MiTMproxy, an attacker can intercept, observe, and manipulate the traffic between the mobile app and the API server in order to see how requests and responses are made, how they are structured, and what secrets are used. If using an MitM proxy is not enough, then an instrumentation framework like Frida or Xposed will allow an attacker to run the mobile app on a device or emulator to intercept system or method calls and/or manipulate the memory of the device in order to understand how the code works, bypass security checks, or extract whatever sensitive data the attacker is interested in. An all-in-one solution for reverse-engineering exists by the name of Mobile Security Framework. It only requires the mobile app binary to be uploaded â€” and then the process of extracting the source code, finding secrets, and potential security vulnerabilities is automated, and a very detailed report is given in the end. This tool can also be used while the mobile app is running to perform a dynamic analysis of what the code is doing and what traffic is going in and out, just like you would do with a discrete set of tools.
