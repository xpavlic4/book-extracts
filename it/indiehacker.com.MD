Customer Segmentation

Depending on how you obtained the interview/how much background you have on the person, you may need to make sure they are within your customer segment, and/or understand more about their demographic. I usually try to keep it to a max of three.

What do you do professionally?
Who handles [process you’re improving] at your home/office?
Tell me about your role at [company]?
How much time do you spend on [process you’re improving]?
[Specific questions related to your product/customer] – for example, do you have kids?
</pre>
<pre>
Problem Discovery
Questions to validate your hypothesis about a problem, or to learn about problems.

What’s the hardest part of your day?
What are some unmet needs you have?
What product do you wish you had that doesn’t exist yet?
What tasks take up the most time in your day?
What could be done to improve your experience with [process/role]?
What’s the hardest part about being a [demographic]?
What are your biggest/most important professional responsibilities/goals?
What are your biggest/most important personal responsibilities/goals?
</pre>

Problem Validation
If your customer did not talk about the problem you wanted to address, use the below questions to begin validating/invalidating that your customer has the problem you think they have. In addition, it’s often not enough to just solve a problem, sometimes it also needs to be one that people are highly motivated to solve. Some of the below questions can help with that too.

Do you find it hard to [process/problem]?
How important is [value you’re delivering] to you?
Tell me about the last time you [process you’re improving] – listen for complaints
How motivated are you to solve/improve [problem/process]?
If you had a solution to this problem, what would it mean to you/how would it affect you?
</pre>
<pre>
Product Discovery
Questions to help generate ideas or to validate your idea. The below questions are intentionally very open-ended. By asking yes or no questions specifically related to your product, customers may feel inclined to agree with you or not be critical. By asking more open ended questions, you can be more confident that they’re giving you honest input. If in response to the questions below, your customers tell you they’re looking for similar to what you have in mind, you might be on to something.

What do you think could be done to help you with [problem]?
What would your ideal solution to this problem look like?
If you could wave a magic wand and instantly have any imaginable solution to this problem, what would it look like? – I’ve found that about 80% the time the answers I get to this question are not very informative – solutions that aren’t feasible or most certainly wouldn’t be profitable. But the other 20% of the time there are some really informative responses that make the other 80% acceptable.  
What’s the hardest part about [process you’re improving]?
What are you currently doing to solve this problem/get this value?
What do you like and dislike about [competing product or solution]?
</pre>
<pre>
Product Validation
Questions to validate/invalidate your idea.

What do you think of this product? – this question is intentionally vague. Listen to whether they talk about wanting to use the product or how it could be improved. Given how vague the question is, the former is positive, while the latter may be a sign that improvement is needed.
Would this product solve your problem?
How likely are you/would you be to tell your friends about this product?
Would you ever use this product?
Would you be willing to start using this right away?
What might prevent you from using this product? – might reveal ways that you could improve the product. Potential hurdles might be budget, time, perception’s of the product’s value, a competing product, etc.
Will you pay $x for this product? – see if they will put their proverbial money where their math is. Often times when you ask this question, no matter how small the price, you will start hearing key insights that you wouldn’t have heard otherwise.
</pre>
<pre>
Product Optimization
Questions to help you improve your idea or product.

What could be done to improve this product?
What would make you want to tell your friends about this product?
What’s most appealing to you about this product?
What might improve your experience using the product?
What motivates you to continue using this product?
What’s the hardest part about using this product?
What features do you wish the product had?
</pre>
<pre>
Ending Interviews
Questions to ask at the end of an interview. You may also need to ask for their contact information if you don’t already have it.

[Summarize some of your key takeaways] – is that accurate? – I usually do this throughout the interview.
So based on the conversation, it sounds like x is really hard for you, but y is not. How accurate is that?
It sounds like x is very important to you, while y is not. How accurate is that?
Is there anything else you think I should know about that I didn’t ask?
Do you know anyone else who might also have this problem that I could ask similar questions to? – small form of validation if they’re willing to give you referrals
Can I keep you in the loop on how the product develops?
Can I follow up with you if I have more questions?

## Bootstrapping lessons learned

Bootstrapping is about launching products on existing markets (so the idea is already validated), niche it down ideally to 1000 customers worldwide (1000 x $50/m, ±$500k/y), then niche it down again to reach and segment target audience easily, establish better execution and UX as a main competitive advantage (and to attract competitors refugees) and find your flywheel via semi-automated marketing/content creation (to achieve the lowest possible CPA). Don't create new markets, don't chase innovative ideas. Prefer optimization over innovation.

Bootstrapping (and entrepreneurship) is a career. Don't expect quick results. Stack bricks one by one. Stairstep rather than jump. Run a marathon, not a sprint. Do back-envelop estimations and plan to spend on one project three years rather than three months. Read/Listen Rob Walling today.

You don't have a business if you don't have profit. Be always profit first. Pay yourself first, then pay your creditors.

Start marketing before coding.

Start write/collect your content before marketing.

Recognize and write down your product value metric. Read/Listen Patric Campbell today.

Niche down, then niche down again.

On-boarding should guide a user on how to get value from the product in less than 30 seconds and nothing else.

Eliminate as much friction as possible along the user-to-customer journey in your product. In extreme show your offer to a user right after on-boarding.

Avoid trials - they prolong user's journey to your offer, put time constraints to a potential customer and force them to focus on your product (that's bad as we all have ADHD). Prefer freemium to trials where you could restrict the user's ability to get more value from the product keeping it just on a bare minimum. The user should stumble upon the product's "value metric" every session and suffer by not able to have it all. If you concerned of support burden for the free tier make registration private and rechannel the rest of the traffic to a waiting list.

Always collect emails. On an early stage prefer email collection to conversion. You have better chances to reactivate user with email than reactivate a lost visitor without one.

Always be testing. There is always a better version of your product (and more profit) waiting for you in just a couple of commits.

Any hype is good for your content/marketing strategy. People love controversy. Consider: "10 reasons why PayPal is better than Stripe for your info products checkout page" or "How bootstrapping ruined my life. Drained and divorced with $150k in debt".

Sell on value rather than on price: products with product-market-fit either making money, saving money or saving your time.

Charge more, it's the easiest and most controllable way to immediately increase your revenue. Read/listen Patric McKenzie today.

Charge more, reconsider (rise) your pricing monthly while something bad won't happen (you'll see it as significant conversion drop/churn rate increase). Read/listen Jason Cohen today.

Optimize conversion. It's the second most important way to increase your revenue after pricing. Fix your leaked bucket before double down on marketing. Squeeze any penny from the current product state before moving forward and build more features.

Invest your time into 1. conversion optimization 2. execution (UX) 3. marketing rather than new features.

Don't ship features. If you are developing new features stop today and think which one to remove without losing your UVP.

A new feature in your product should always serve a new segment of your potential customers. Build it just after you already optimized the previous version of your MVP. If it's not the case you probably don't have an MVP.

Be able to dynamically change pricing to your service in seconds (not days) through your admin panel (or DB).

Make sure your bounce back rate is low, otherwise you attract the wrong audience.

Bootstrappers don't build products. They build marketing/conversion systems around MVPs, optimize them and replicate what works.

Choose products that could be scaled horizontally to serve similar audiences. This way you could replicate the system and product relatively easy, target a different segment of customers and multiply your revenue.

Build technical platforms to reuse them to multiply success.

Use boring technologies, that decreasing the cost of bootstrapping and code maintenance. Hack around for fun, not for profit.

Don't forget to use Black Fridays/ XMas sales to close more deals from your mailing list.

Implement promo codes and offer a small discount to everyone in your mailing list as a part of your drip campaign.

Use "Unlock" CTA rather than "Upgrade" CTA. People naturally love to unlock doors (paywalls).
