There is no difference between dating and sales.

People donâ€™t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.

Do business only with people who believe in your why.

Those who trust are best employees. Don't lie to your doctor and your employees.

Best companies hired motivated people and inspired them.

We trust more someone in our proximity than someone from other city even if he had more experienced.
