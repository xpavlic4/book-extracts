# Neuro-Linguistic Programming

Behavioural Frames - ways of thinking about how you act

NLP adopst an attitude of Curiosity and Fascination rather than making Assumptions.

Our consciousness is limited to seven plus or minus two pieces of information.
Our unconscious, by contrast, is all that we have learned.

The Four Stages of Learing:
* Unconscious Incompetence (you don't know that you don't know)
* Conscious Incompetence (you know that you dont' know)
* Conscious Competence (you know, but you have to concentrate on it)
* Unconscious Competence (you don'' know that you know)

Basics of NLP:
* know what you want; have a clear idea of your outcome in any situation
* be alert and keep you senses open so you have feedback
* be flexible and change things until you get what you want

Outcomes Summary (POSERS mnemonic):
* positive, think of what you want rather than what you do not want
* own part, has to be within your control
* specific, be concise
* evidence, feel it, hear, see it, more senses
* resources, do you have them?
* size, if too big divide in smaller chunks

The understanding of the meaning of the communication
* 55% Body Language
* 7% Words
* 38% Voice Tonality

Rapport (a close and harmonious relationship)
* mirror each other in posture, gesture and eye contact
* voice matching (tonality, speed, volume, rhythm)
* pacing - start mirroring emotions and slowly change into positive
* use "and" instead of "but"

## The Doors of Perception

* much of our thinkinng is typically a mixture of these remembered and constructed sense impressions
* visual system can be external or internal (when mentally visualizing)
* auditory system external or internal
* kinesthetics external (touch, temperature, moisture) vs internal kinesthetics (remembered sensations, emotions)

## Lead System
* think back again to your vacation, what comes first - a picture, sound or a feeling?

## Eye accessing Cues
* looking up left and up is how most right-handed people remember images
* looking down and right is the way people get in touch with their feelings
