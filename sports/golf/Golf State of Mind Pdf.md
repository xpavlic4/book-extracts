# Module 2: Fundamental Mental Game Concepts
Motivation can be either internal or external. Internal means motivation in the skill itself. External means you get something as a reward outside of the skill (e.g. money or recognition).

Exercise: Think about where you want to go and what is the purpose of it. Define long-term goal and list 5 reasons why you want to do it.

The mindset is either growth or fixed mindset. Growth means improvements is paved by failures. Fixed means your ability is pre-defined.

Stages of a round:
* Pre-round
* Pre-shot
* During the shot
* Post-shot
* In between shots
* Post-round

## Process thinking vs Outcome thinking
Focus on "the process" rather than on the result.

## Breathing inhale vs. exhale ratio
* 6 seconds to inhale
* 2 seconds pause
* 12 seconds to exhale
* repeat until your heart rate lowered

## Lowering Tension
* do a body scan to find out where your tension is
* use breathing techniques while focusing on tense area to dissolve the tension
* to relieve your tension in your jaw try to put your tongue in between your teeth

## Slow everything down
* you subconsciously want to move quicker to get you out of the
uncomfortable situation
* if you feel nervous deliberately slow down your walk, routine and swing

## Body language
* when you feel confident you have more Testosterone
*  “high-power” postures (standing up, back straight, shoulders back) generates more Testosterone
* facial expressions - smile as much as possible

### Exercise
Describe your best competitive mindset.

Walking with very optimistic mindset to be able to birdie every hole. Seeing every putt goes into the hole before hitting it.

## Visualization To Rewire The Subconscious
* being super confident on the 1st tee
* playing best and coming down the stretch
* seeing yourself as TOP10 in the world

## Neuro Linguistic Programming for golf
* find a quiet place and sit there for 15 minutes
* meditate until you have a clear mind
* recall your last success, try to get a vivid picture
* bind the feeling with some specific "anchor"
    * verbal triggers  "commit", "smooth and powerful"
    * auditory: humming, golf glove Velcro snap
    * kinesthetic: Tiger blinks, Fowler taps the cap

## Competitive practice
### Managing the time in-between shots
* try staying in the present

* what lie, wind, downhill, uphill
* where is hearth of the green

## Course Strategy
* compile club distances
