# Module 1
The Champion Golfer Profile:
* physical skills like fitness, strength and conditioning, good Nutrition
* technical skills like swing and putting stroke mechanics
* equipment
* mental skills like how you deal with pressure and manage emotions

# Module 2: Fundamental Mental Game Concepts
Motivation can be either internal or external. Internal means motivation in the skill itself. External means you get something as a reward outside of the skill (e.g. money or recognition).

Exercise: Think about where you want to go and what is the purpose of it. Define long-term goal and list 5 reasons why you want to do it.

The mindset is either growth or fixed mindset. Growth means improvements is paved by failures. Fixed means your ability is pre-defined.

Stages of a round:
* Pre-round
* Pre-shot
* During the shot
* Post-shot
* In between shots
* Post-round

## Process thinking vs Outcome thinking
Focus on "the process" rather than on the result. Your process keep you in the present moment. Thinking about the past means thinking about mistakes. Trying to predict the future leads to "performance anxiety".

Exercise: Write all the things that are not within your control during a round and things that are.

Thinks you have to adapt:
* changing weather
* other players
* bad luck
* the golf course (grass, different shots)
* nerves
* focus
* tension (breathe and relax)
* tempo (under pressure you increase your tempo)

# Module 3: How to deal with pressure and play fearless golf

Pressure comes when you feel you have to produce a certain result. Fear is negative emotion caused by uncertainty. During performance you have to focus on process.

Exercise: What causes you to feel under pressure.
