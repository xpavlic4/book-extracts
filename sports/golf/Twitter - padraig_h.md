# Bunker shots
* hit it into the bunker like an axe
* never fight the slope, shoulders go with the slope

# Wedge shots
* the ball slightly ahead of center
* never feel of hitting a wedge hard
* it is about feeling of 3/4, half and full, not exactly the position on clock

# putting
* hold the finish
