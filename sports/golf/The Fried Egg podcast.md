#20230221 Andrew Putnam
* he has the same putting drills as 20 years ago
* mirror, string line, one handed putting, simple break
* read putts with his feet
* once he starts thinking it is bad
* he asked Badelay (the best putter ever) where he is aiming and he said he don't know
* when you are hot you have to play agressive, because bogey costs you 40 thousands, birdie gets you 150 thousands
* he never set goal, just concentrate on daily gains
