# childlike vs childish
To be childlike is to have a simple fascination in getting the ball into the hole and to love the task of doing so. To be childish is to expect a certain outcome will come your way, that you 'deserve' to hole the putt or that you shouldn't muss from a certain distance.

# Einstein cliche
The definition of insanity is to keep doing the same things over and over again and expect a different result.

The biggest and most lasting golfing improvements are made through adopting and applying a different mental outlook and approach, rather than trying to master or perfect physical skills or movements. When concepts change physical movement often improves.

You become the story you tell yourself the most often.

Focus on what you can achieve instead of what might go wrong.

# Chapter 1
You become the putter you think you are.
When your brain has a clear idea of what not to do and has an even clearer road map of what to do, then you can create an incredible opportunity for lasting change.
We become stories what we tell others.
The choise to change the story is yours.

# Chapter 2
Do not follow putter head after impact.

# Chapter 3
When you have a clear intent to what you want this putt to do in this moment and you trust your body to organise it, what can happen is fascinating.
Do not try to make a perfect stroke.

# Chapter 4 - Line and Pace
Pace is key and pace is king, pace gives you options.
The size of hole is 4.25 (length of a dollar bill). Each revolution is 5.26 inches long. Each revolution shrinks the effective width of the hole by 12 percent.

6 inches past | 3.8 hole width

| past  |  hole width  |
|---|---|
| 6 inch  | 3.8  |
|  1 foot | 2.6  |
|  2 feet |  1.9 |
|  3 feet |  1.4 |

Track your putts, short, long, left, right, right-to-left break, 6 feet, uphill...
When on the putting green, practice only with one ball. Just work on tempo.
