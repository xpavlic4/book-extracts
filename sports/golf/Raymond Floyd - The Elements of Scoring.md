# Elements of Scoring
Scorer - someone who gets consistently the most of his skill level.

Top 10 mistakes amateurs make:
* underclubbing
* swinging too hard
* shooting at the flag
* not playing away of trouble
* missing the green on the wrong side
* trying too much out of trouble
* trying to pull up shots they never practiced
* panicking in the sand
* misreading turf and lie condition
* underreading the break of the putt

Two basic principles: play comfortable and avoid big mistakes

## Knowing your game
Measure your carry distances.
Solid contact is key measure of how good striker you are.
Know you shot pattern and your usual miss.
Practice putting from 6 feet a lot.

## What every scorer does
play within yourself
gradually get more confident as you trying for more during the round
playing comfortably within what you have that given day
risks create pressure and a negative mind-set

### big mistake
you sense the danger
OB is the worst, thick rough is next
every hole has bailout area - safe route to play the hole

have a safety shot - something ugly that works every time you have B or C game
one shot at a time
let someone else track your score, amateurs are not trained to ignore the consequences of looking at the scorecard
