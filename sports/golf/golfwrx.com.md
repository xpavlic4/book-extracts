# 5 ways of not being a choker
* shift your focus to what you desired outcome is (not negative like dont hit that bunker)
* learn through observation, not by step-by-step instruction
* pre-shot routine shifts the mind away from too much outcome thinking
* 

# 10 little things that will make a big difference in your game
* first putt - focus on aspects that affect speed
* 3 stages of bunker play - get out, get onto and get close
* let go of score - do not keep track of where you stand with par on a moment-to-moment basis
* Elevation affects distance - take into consideration in the think box
* playing from side-hill lies
  - above your feet curves to the Left
  - below your feet curves to the right
* avoid the big number - no hero shots when you are in troubles
* playing in the wind is much more difficult
* make your misses count - perfect round doesn't exist, play good misses
* play the course for shape - plan one shot ahead to have the best angle, uphill putt etc.
