# How to become a scratch golfer
## Birdie mindset
Aim to birdie every hole, or git yourself a birdie chance. Think every hole as a opportunity to score birdie instead of shooting a par.

# Practice areas
* reduce the size of big misses of the tee
* distance control 50-150 yards
* chipping 10-30 yards
* putting inside 6ft and 10-25ft
