# How to stay in the zone
* do not judge, do not focus on the outcome
# How champions plan for every outcome
* practice all possible shortgame shots so you have confidence on the teebox, you know no matter what happend you can play that shortgame shot. Otherwise it is in the back of your mind and you unconsciousnessly avoid it.

# Mental coaching goals
* play in a competition the same way how you play in your practice round
* practice efficiency - routine, learning principles

# How to control your temper
* temper - getting frustrated with things in the past
* control your personal triggers and how you react to them, create different responces

# Micro vs. Macro goals

Micro goal is goal for each individual shot. Macro goal is "I want to shoot in 90s".
The only goal to set is number of greens and number of up/downs in the round.
