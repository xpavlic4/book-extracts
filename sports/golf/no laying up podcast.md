* when you think "I am just make cut here and there I will get my tour card" you will never get it, your attitude has to be I am going to win. Example would be Brooks Koepka, he played on Challenge Tour and was fighting for a cut, then realized he can win and he won. Did the same on the European Tour, where his attitude was like - hey I am good, I won on the Challenge Tour, I can win on the ET and he won eventually.
