# Extraordinary golf
Most golfers are:
* uncommitted, except to looking good
* constantly judging
* on the verge of being upset

## Introspective vs. extrospective
Look around and see where you are, who you are playing with. Forget about "you", ask who your partners are. In golf you are creating or dying.

People get upset about shots because they think they will repeat it in the future again. But future is not determined by the past. Keep your possibilities and your future open.

## Why people play golf
Combination of:
* joy
* satisfaction
* personal growth
* fulfillment

Learning and enjoyment are good foundation for good performance. Play the game you want to play, that gives you joy and satisfaction. Play with freedom and enthusiasm.

## Learning possibilities
Develop an awareness of your golf swing without judging it.
Try extremes:
* inside-out, outside-in **very** slow
* high, low, hook, slice
* mimic the way how we learn walking raiding a bike as a kids

## Concentration
Phases:
1. Key swing thoughts
2. Reconnect with ball at the top of the back-swing
3. Anticipation of impact
4. Evaluation of impact
5. Evaluation of ball in flight

## Club throwing experiment
Experiment where you should swing the club without a ball on the ground and try to release it towards the target.
Back-swing to downswing ratio is 3 to 1 (normal) vs 2:1 (in throwing), i.e. many people try to slow down before impact
understanding is the lowest step in learning

## Coaching
- Coach only when asked, let pupil decide when they want.
- Coach only when you are asked to coach. (coaching the length of back-swing means don't comment on weight shift)
- Set time limit for coaching.

## Teaching a child
* basic instruction only (keep your head straight)
* ask "what did you learn" instead of "what did you shot"
* lead by examples (child learn by who you are not by what you say)

## Learning vs stepping out of your comfort zone
Learning and growth require a willingness to explore and take risks which often leads to confusion and discomfort.

## Trust of muscle memory
Things in your head are those you cannot trust, only things ingrained in your body. Swing is so complicated you cannot govern it consciously. That's why you should swing without a swing thought

## Competition is you against you
It is you versus you (your competitor supports you in your growth). Your competitor is your ally not adversary.

## Future of golf
* extraordinary people live lives backwards. They create a future and live into it. Similar to 7 habits: begin with the end of your mind
* possibility of new future - everything is open whereas expectations are fixed, either/or and lead to failed expectations.

## Source of consistency is your deepest you
The deepest part of you doesn't change. You have to experience it and play from it. Golf is expression of what you are.

# Exercises

## Putting into unknown space
Try to be aware of the space behind the hole. Your brain doesn't like to putt into unknown areas. That's why many putts are short-term.

## Playing
Do not make an excuses when you hit a bad shot. Excuses (alias stories) lives in your head and reduces awareness.

## Purpose of playing golf
* write down why you really play golf
* what makes you really happy

# Driving range session meditation without any judging
* hit a bucket of balls without judging it
* just observing, not try-to-fix, let the chatter be, no evaluations. let it go as clouds on the sky, just be aware but do not judge them

## Concentration
Pick one of:
* the ball
* the club
* the body
* the environment

try to concentrate on one during your whole swing. find a blind spot (a place where you lost your focus). compare with other elements and decide which one you kept the focus longest.
