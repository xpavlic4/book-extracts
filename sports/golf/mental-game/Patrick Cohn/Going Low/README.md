# Going low - Patrick Cohn Ph.D.

## Breaking free of restrictive beliefs
Identify the problem behaviour - negative self-fulfilling prophecy

Syndrom 1: I will most like shoot...
 * expectation-based syndrome
 * root of problem: by saying it you're in the comfort-zone
Remedy 1:
 * don't set target score or focus on what you score
 * "I need to make a cut" attitude vs "Win every tournament" attitude. The first one is already assuming you are going to strugle

Syndrom 2: Here I go again
 * double bogey, high number, blowing the lead in the beginning
Remedy 2: 
* self-fulfilling prophecies - something happened in the past will happen again
* do not assume/generalize that history will repeat inself in negative/positive way

Syndrome 3: I will do it again
* pessimist or negative thinker do not achieve
* every bad thing is a sign, you are searching for a negative labels and internalize them, live by them

Remedy 3:
* use positive labels instead

Syndrome 4: I am not that good.
* self-desctruction denial of success
* hard to develop a confidence with this syndrome

Remedy 4:
* reward yourself for good shots
* learn and accept compliments and integrate them into your identity
* see failures as learning experiences

Syndrome 5: Can't make mistakes
* most perfectionists have this one
* analyzing rounds based on have many mistakes you made

Remedy 5: 
* forget about playing a perfect round, there will always be mistakes

Syndrome 6: I don't have it today
* thinking a perfect round is possible only when all parts of game are excellent

Remedy 6:
* focus on your strengths
* good putting and course management can save any round

## Catching momentum
* prepare yourself mentally by believing you can play well
* recall good experiences
* do not concern with a poor warmup - doens't mean anything
* get momentum from good shots early in the round
* play shot by shot, no expectations about final score
* don't make any generalizations about your round based on history, stay confident during shaky start (things can turn around pretty quickly)

## Regain momentum when it's lost

* play every hole as a mini-game (you start fresh after every hole)
* "I am just not lucky today" means you are looking for/ expecting bad events to happen
