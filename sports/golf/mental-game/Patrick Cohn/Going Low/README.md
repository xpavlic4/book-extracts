# Going low - Patrick Cohn Ph.D.

## Breaking free of restrictive beliefs
Identify the problem behaviour - negative self-fulfilling prophecy

Syndrom 1: I will most like shoot...
 * expectation-based syndrome
 * root of problem: by saying it you're in the comfort-zone
Remedy 1:
 * don't set target score or focus on what you score
 * "I need to make a cut" attitude vs "Win every tournament" attitude. The first one is already assuming you are going to strugle

Syndrom 2: Here I go again
 * double bogey, high number, blowing the lead in the beginning
Remedy 2: 
* self-fulfilling prophecies - something happened in the past will happen again
* do not assume/generalize that history will repeat inself in negative/positive way

Syndrome 3: I will do it again
* pessimist or negative thinker do not achieve
* every bad thing is a sign, you are searching for a negative labels and internalize them, live by them

Remedy 3:
* use positive labels instead

Syndrome 4: I am not that good.
* self-desctruction denial of success
* hard to develop a confidence with this syndrome

Remedy 4:
* reward yourself for good shots
* learn and accept compliments and integrate them into your identity
* see failures as learning experiences

Syndrome 5: Can't make mistakes
* most perfectionists have this one
* analyzing rounds based on have many mistakes you made

Remedy 5: 
* forget about playing a perfect round, there will always be mistakes

Syndrome 6: I don't have it today
* thinking a perfect round is possible only when all parts of game are excellent

Remedy 6:
* focus on your strengths
* good putting and course management can save any round

## Catching momentum
* prepare yourself mentally by believing you can play well
* recall good experiences
* do not concern with a poor warmup - doens't mean anything
* get momentum from good shots early in the round
* play shot by shot, no expectations about final score
* don't make any generalizations about your round based on history, stay confident during shaky start (things can turn around pretty quickly)

## Regain momentum when it's lost

* play every hole as a mini-game (you start fresh after every hole)
* "I am just not lucky today" means you are looking for/ expecting bad events to happen

## Transcending mechanics in the zone

when playing think only the target and the feeling of desired shot
playing target golf is playing in the zone
develop feeling of a good swing

## Plaing target golf

one wing thought max. during the play
brain cannot process multiple thoughts
best swing-thoughts are tempo-related
the image of a target is all you need to initiate a golf swing

## Practicing
one teacher in life, one philosophy (switching teachers is time-consuming)
stop beating golf balls on the range (simulate play on-course instead, every shot must have a purpose)

## Finding the flow

best players score the best when they play simple
do not focus on score during your play
when you try really hard to be better your mind will be occupied by working all the details. play simple instead
leave your life problems at home, play with clear mind
don't overanalyze - e.g. overreading green (your brain has too many inputs and cannot decide what to do)

## playing boring golf
understanding what you are capable of

### home-course traps 
* where you know people you play with
* you care about people you play with

Social evaluations
* fear of being the center of attention
* negative group dynamics (willingness to let others in the group affect one's performance)

## Type of negative emotions
*fear of loosing a tournament with a big lead
* anxiety of playing with a lead
* frustration after a bogey

## Mental traps
* need for approval (to be liked by others) is caused by low self-esteem
* fear of embarrasment (of hitting a bad shot) 
    - solution "There is nothing to fear but fear itself", ie. you can breathe, you are safe, you do not have to fear anything

*stage fright - fear of being the center of attention

## need for approval
either you belive in yourself or you seek confidence from others. others do not judge you based on how good or bad you play.

## flow
you do not worry what others think about you
you are totally absorbed in the immediate shot without consequences
you are instinctively reacting to environment

## Requirements to get into flow

clear goals plus feedback how you are doing, goal is e.g. shot at the target with clean impact
become immerse in the task
perception of the difficulty of the task
 * boredom interrupts flow (too easy)
 * anxiety interreupts flow (too difficult)

## When you are playing a good round
never think about final score
never count an easy holes to bring birdies
dont back off. never
play fearless but still percentage golf
get as far as possible
follow a game plan
* targets off the tee
* hole strategy
* commit to the plan no matter what

when feeling pressure - lock your mind into pre-shot routine

## Signs that golf is too important for you
golf workaholic - other facets of life suffer
daily routine is arranged around golf, golf practice is 1st priority
conscious mind is golf only, off-time you still have golf on your mind
you feel angry when not practicing or playing
obsessed with playing well, perfectionist
thrill of competition acts like a drug
you want to give up cause you cannot play up to your expectations
mental and physical  burnout of golf

## golf is not a reflection of who you are
play good => feel good
play bad -> feel good too
self-worth is not linked to 
self-esteem must be based on my values as a person
people in your life will still love you no matter how good golfer(father, husband, bussinessman) you are

## balance in your life
following 
1. self-care/health
2. family and friends
3. career
4. reacreation/hobies

## pressure
pressure comes from worrying about outcomes
working the process is the best method to achieve good outcomes
e.g. thinking about making a putt for par is outcome focus - not desired
think about a process instead - tasks that lead to making the putt
be immersed in smaller tasks

# Personal scoring zones

* scoring zone is your comfort zone, eg. I always score 90
* breaking scor. zone unlocks confidence to shot lower

* disqualifying the positive things or downplay achievements, attribute good shots to luck doesn't contribute to confidence

people attribute success or failure to:
1. effort
2. ability ("I don't have the ability" what people usually say who do not have a confidence)
3. difficulty of task (difficult course rating)
4. luck e.g. "out of luck today"    

## Thinking beyond the box
* self-image "I shot in the 80s" is limiting you, use self-talk to internalize "I am good putter and improve short game" instead.
* self-talk has to be positive & self-empowering

## Reward yourself
* don't make excuses, don't attribute low scores to luck
* recall what you did good
* review with rose-colored glasses
* reward yourself after a good round (beer, chocolate etc.)

## Set goals
* goals are not expectations
* goals are e.g. number of GIRs or FIRs, total putts, birdie oportunities, number of 3-putts, number of up/downs


## Acknowledge your fears
if you play for fun - ignore fears
if you want to win tournaments
* face fear face-on
* ask yourself "What's the worst thing that could happen?", it is usually nothing serious
* if you fail, your true friends or family will still love you
* if you win, everybody will forget that sooner or later

# Breaking 80 or 70
## On the way to the course
1. check all clubs
2. rain gear, umbrella if weather ask for it
3. glove + extra one
4. set up a course strategy
 * what club at what tee
 * small targets to aim at
 * par-5s layups
 * follow game-plan no matter what

play favourite song in the car to get you in the mood

free your mind of any expectations of target score, only exception is (# of GIRs or FIRs)

## Warming up
* visualize shots on driving range
* full mental preshot routine every shot
* no swing mechanic, no swing changes, swing what you have now

# First tee shot
* visualize the shot
* relax and talk with partners
* write your goal on the scorecard
* focus on the process
* if you are not ready than restart the routine

## Opening holes
* stick to the plan
* plan percentage shots
* if you start bumpy look for positive signs

## Middle holes
* don't add up your score for front nine
* if you play good you know
