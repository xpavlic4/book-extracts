# Mental principles
## Stay in the present, commit to the process
Dont think about future birdies/pars. Always commit to the very next thing to do.
## Pre-Shot Routine (PSR)
Should bring you into best possible state mentally and physically to execute a quality golf shot.
PSR has two distinct phases:
* Decide (D)
* Execute (E)

D is logical phase, gathering information and deciding what to do. Take wind, uphill, hazards into consideration. E is reacting phase. You trust your decision. You visualize the shot. You see the flight, where it lands.

The E phase to the PSR is a reaction to the shot in front of you. You have the information, you react.

## Accept phase (A)
accept whatever happens after you have hit the ball. you are OK with whatever happens. The only thing you can control while playing the game is what you do up until the ball leaves the clubface.

## Precise Target
"Aim small, miss small".
Golf is *NOT* about the quality of you r good shots, it is about the quality of you *BAD* ones.

## Switching on and off
Concentration for 4 or more hours is almost impossible. Break the round up into 72 (if you shoot par) bursts of focus rather than say 10 longer periods. Switch off the mind after you hit the shot and swith it back on before you hit your next one. Have a physical cue to swith into both modes, e.g. glove.

you hit the shot, and undo the glove is hint to switch off. also try meditation when walking the fairway. when 20 meters from the ball you should put the glove on again and that triggers the ON mode. or use narrow and wide focus.

# Summary of Mental Principles for the Golf Course
* What do I have to do right now?
* Stay in the present, commit to the process
* Pre-shot routine (PSR):
 - Decide: gather information
 - Execute: See your shot and commit
* Accept: let the results take care of themselves
* precise target: aim small, miss small
* switch on and off: glove

# Swing thoughts
For the average golfer and pro alike, having only one thought is essential for playing well.
Focus on you pre-shot routine only. The tempo is the number-one contributor to good putting on the golf course.

# Before a tournament
* wake up fresh
* no alcohol the night before
* drive slower to the couse as usual

# Game day
## Range 20 minutes
* range is for finding a good rhythm
* hit balls for 20 minutes (wedge, 7i, 3i and driver)
* hit 6i with full pre-shot routine on specific target
* final swing on the range is tee-shot on the first hole
## Short game area 10 minutes
* some chips
* bunker shots

# Grinders
Remain in the present, go through you process as each shot presents itself, and not worry about the sate of your game.

# Awareness of negatives
Start a round of golf and put a handful (20 or more) tees in you left pocket. Every time you have a negative thought, tak e a tee out and put it in your right pocket. See how many holes you go before your left pocket is empty.

Use negatives as cue to give your mind focus and get back into the present mode.

# Match play
if you fall behind to your oponent early, it is important not to try and push things. be patient and play your game.
Look at the oponent, if his head is down and feet is draging, you have to grind out every hole.
Once you are ahead, putt your foot down and keep trying to increase your lead rather than defend it.
You can also consede a putt when the distance is more than 3-feet so that your opponent get the feeling you are generous today. And when the situation comes you let him play the putt. The shock should give him stab in the back.

# Strategy
Hit fairways, hit greens, have a good short game and play to your strenght.

# The little voice
Little voice is the inner voice when you do something hard and it suggests you compromises. E.g. getting early and little voice is telling you to sleep longer. gives exceuses and justify it.
If you beat the little voice in practice, it gives you the strenght to beat it in the competition. At every stage of your progress, you will be tested and it is how you respond that defines you as a person. your biggest opponent will be yourself and the little voice. embrace the challenge and see it as a moment to step up and work harder. at the end of the day if you can stand in front of the mirror and honestly say you gave it everything you had, you will have no regrets. more than likely you wll have succeeded too.

# How to practice
The game has two areas:
* full Swing
* wedges and in (putting, sand, chips, pitches)

You should spend 2:1 time in favour of wedges and in. Have a plan what to practice.

## advanced player (single digit hcp)
for an hour, divide it into thirds:
* 20 mins fundamentals
* 20 mins on skills
* 20 mins on competitive scenarios

During the fundamentals I am not too concerned about where the ball is going. Focus on the technical aspect of my swing.
Than try to hit various trajectories.
Three in a row drill - three shots in a row between two targets, e.g. 6i tp 170 yards that are 7 yards wide
