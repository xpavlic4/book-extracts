# Mental principles
## Stay in the present, commit to the process
Dont think about future birdies/pars. Always commit to the very next thing to do.
## Pre-Shot Routine (PSR)
Should bring you into best possible state mentally and physically to execute a quality golf shot.
PSR has two distinct phases:
* Decide (D)
* Execute (E)

D is logical phase, gathering information and deciding what to do. Take wind, uphill, hazards into consideration. E is reacting phase. You trust your decision. You visualize the shot. You see the flight, where it lands.

The E phase to the PSR is a reaction to the shot in front of you. You have the information, you react.

## Accept phase (A)
accept whatever happens after you have hit the ball. you are OK with whatever happens. The only thing you can control while playing the game is what you do up until the ball leaves the clubface.

## Precise Target
"Aim small, miss small".
Golf is *NOT* about the quality of you r good shots, it is about the quality of you *BAD* ones.

## Switching on and off
Concentration for 4 or more hours is almost impossible. Break the round up into 72 (if you shoot par) bursts of focus rather than say 10 longer periods. Switch off the mind after you hit the shot and swith it back on before you hit your next one. Have a physical cue to swith into both modes, e.g. glove.

you hit the shot, and undo the glove is hint to switch off. also try meditation when walking the fairway. when 20 meters from the ball you should put the glove on again and that triggers the ON mode. or use narrow and wide focus.

# Summary of Mental Principles for the Golf Course
* What do I have to do right now?
* Stay in the present, commit to the process
* Pre-shot routine (PSR):
 - Decide: gather information
 - Execute: See your shot and commit
* Accept: let the results take care of themselves
* precise target: aim small, miss small
* switch on and off: glove

# Swing thoughts
For the average golfer and pro alike, having only one thought is essential for playing well.
Focus on you pre-shot routine only. The tempo is the number-one contributor to good putting on the golf course.

# Before a tournament
* wake up fresh
* no alcohol the night before
* drive slower to the couse as usual

# Game day
## Range 20 minutes
* range is for finding a good rhythm
* hit balls for 20 minutes (wedge, 7i, 3i and driver)
* hit 6i with full pre-shot routine on specific target
* final swing on the range is tee-shot on the first hole
## Short game area 10 minutes
* some chips
* bunker shots
