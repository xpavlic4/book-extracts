# Master human skills
Pillars of golfer's game:
* fitness level
* technical skills
* equipment
* human skills

but only the human skills can change during the play, all other is set.

#Awareness
Golfers have specific tendencies, recurring patterns when playing well and when they don't play well.

* physical awareness
* mental Awareness
    * shot selection
    * course strategy
    * every cognitive thought

The highest level of execution, whether by a pianist, golfer, dancer is controlled by the right or sensory part of the brain, and is characterized by a shift away from the conscious brain to the subconscious brain- the zone or flow.
The present is all there is in golf. There is nothing else. The more you can figure out how to get yourself to the present during your round, the better you will play. The fun part for each player is to find out his own path to the present.

# Variability
Human skills are what you can truly control on the golf course.

Questions:

* how do you feel when you start off your round well or bad
* how do you perform with different kinds of players
* how do you perform with different types of courses
* how do you manage changes in your body, mind and emotions during your round.

On-Course explorations:
* hit shot you would not normally hit with that club, but stay committed
* pick something what distracts you and hit the shot
* play speed golf, run between shots, shortest routine
* take time between shots and routine, play extra slow
* play from different tee box
* tee off with with conservative strategy where you would normally hit the driver
* play shots and give yourself bad lies every time
* play with a feeling of being tight, what shots you are struggling with
* play a hot and do lumber-jacks before every shot (adrenaline in your blood)
