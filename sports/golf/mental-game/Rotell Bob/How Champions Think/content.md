# How Champions think

## Optimism
you could be the best

smile a bit before each putt

before going to bed, replay your round with edited bad shots

correlation between success & optimism is not clear,
whereas correlation between failure & negative thinking is clear

## Confident Self-image
mental preparation - 15-20 minutes before sleep:

	* must be detailed, vivid
	* persuade unconsciousnes mind it happened
	
## Respecting your talent
you have to be a legend in your own mind

before you can be a legent in your own time.

## Commitment
Devise a plan and commit yourselft to it, persevere.

Fall in love with golf.

Train in and trust it. Subconscious will guide you.

Never give in to doubt, fear or fatique.

## Dream, Goals and rocess
create a dream and use it as a process

step-by-step goal

	* 10x onto green from a bunker
	* 10x close to the hole
	* 10x up&down
	
low goals mean you are not going to fail

aim high, people have to think you are crazy

## Being single-minded
single minded person putts in time to meet his standard high

always seek and discover a reason to belive in you

## Performance process
think of "process" and "spot" when putting

train it and trust it

commit to first instinkt

	1. club selection
	2. target
	3. putt read

do not clutter mind with conscious thoughts

practice putting with one bll only inc. routine

subconscious should govern your moves

middle path

	1. don't overjoy victories
	2. don't distraught after loses

## Evaluation
champions rarely let themselves be influenced by outside evaluations

don't evaluate in the middle of the round

keep separate list of practice and performance goals

## Going thgouth the fire
be resilient 0 find something you can cling to 

failure is needed

## Working smart
full routine before every practice shot

refresh mind with family, leave work at the office

## Competition
pay attention to competition during practice ignore during the round

play your game

safety and severity important for an individual, not exceptional people

competition is needed to push you to the highest level

## Surround yourselft with right people
people must belive in you

stay with one couch forever

## Stick with bread and butter
stick whit one swing, listen to your trainer and ignore tips from others

## Reality
belive in your reality

short-term goals should be realistic

dreams unbounded

crete a persona and belive in it

safe, secure and ultimately dull life is not what exceptional people live

the only failure is failure to try

journey is more important than destination
