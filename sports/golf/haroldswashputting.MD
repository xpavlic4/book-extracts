## Eye dominance
Choose an object in the distance.
Now put both of your hands in front of you so that the object is hidden behind your palms.
Now form a hole between your palms so that the object fits there.
Now close one of your eyes and see if the object is still visible or not.
The majority of people is either left or right eye dominant.

## Putting tempo

The correct putting tempo is 2 (backswing) to 1 (downswing).
Could be measured on an iPhone application named Puttronome.

## Distance in Putting
Time and tempo in putting is constant. Longer putts have also 2:1 ration and the same time spent backswing vs downswing.

## Aimpoint
Check the slope at the beginning of the putt, in the middle and last 1/3 of the path.
Assign a number.
Use that number for number of fingers.
For longer putts (outside 6 feet) use e.g. 3 fingers from the center of the cup.
For shorter putts use 3 fingers from the edge of the hole.

This method doesn't work for me.

## Importance of warm-down
After your round use positive putts to ingrain into your memory.
