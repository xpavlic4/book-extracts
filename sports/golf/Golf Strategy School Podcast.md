# 2 Keys to Putting consistency
* amateurs underestimate the amount of break
* amateurs start the putt agains the apex and end under the cup

## Layering success
* have reasonable expectation, you are not hitting every GIR
* let's say you are very confident with your pitching wedge, but very inconsistent with long irons. You start hitting a fariway 3 times in a row with your pitching wedge. When you have done that, you move on to 9i. Once you hit FIR 3 times in a row with your 9i, you go with 8i etc. Eventually you end up hitting FIR with your 4i. You are broadening your confidence into longer irons.


## How to react to a bad tournament
* is there anything positive I did?
* what do I have to improve mentally/physically to perform better next time

## How to quiet your mind

If you have many swing thoughts during your swing, you are not concentrating on anything. You need to occupy your brain. Try humming. Or try counting down, 5 practice swing, 4 behind the ball, 3 addressing target etc.

## Stay on your plan
Do not follow a bad shot with a dumb one. Bogeys won't kill you, but doubles will.

## Prepare for every outcome
Try to hit every possible/goofy position around the green, so if the situation arise you will be prepared.
