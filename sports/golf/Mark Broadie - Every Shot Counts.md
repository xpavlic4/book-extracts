# Every Shot Counts

## Chapter 1
* people overestimate the importance of putting
* a stroke lost by a wild drive is as important to your score as a stroke lost by missing a putt
* everybody makes two feet putts

## Chapter 2
* "important" shot means there is a scoring difference
* putting contribution to victory (PCV) on PGA Tour is 35%
* if you compare top golfer's performance in all their tournament play, PCV is just 15%
* between any group (pros, good/bad amateurs) the putting contributes 15% to the score differences
* putting is important, but not so much as it is glorified

# Chapter 3
* putts per round is a flawed measure, doesn't take putt distance into account
* strokes gained putting is the tour average number of putts to hole out from a give distance, minus the number of putts taken
* the best golfers gain one stroke per round to an average field
* for an individual putt, strokes gained measures progress to the hole in terms of average putts to hole out rather than distance to the hole

# Chapter 4
* golf simulation allow us to predict the outcome of various golf decisions
* a 90-golfer playing a best-ball scramble against the worst-ball scramble of a pro is a nearly even match
* worst-ball scramble is a good way to practice patience, consistency and course strategy
* best-ball scramble builds confidence
* simulation shows us that long game explains far more about scoring between a pro and an amateur than short game and putting combined

# Chapter 5
* strokes gained positive means the shot was better than average and vice versa
* strokes gained can be used to measure driving, approach shots, short-game shots and putting
* from 8 years of PGA Tour: driving contributed 28%, putting 15% and all other 57% to scoring

# Chapter 6
* shots from 150 yards will finish 50% further from the hole than shots from 100 yards
* driver accuracy in degrees is independent of the shot distance and allow to compare long vs. short hitters
* PGA Tour accuracy is 3.4 degrees, amateur has 6.5
* 1 degree improvement in driving accuracy is 5 yards closer on a 300 yards drive
* 1 degree improvement in driving accuracy is 3/4 of stroke per round for a pro and 0.9 strokes for a typical 90-golfer
* 20 additional meters in driving distance is 3/4 of stroke per round for a pro and 1.6 for a typical 90-golfer
* distance is more important as driving accuracy
* long hitter tend to be straight hitters
* PGA Tour hit 5.5% (21 feet) of initial distance from 10-150 yards, 90-golfer to 12% (45 feet)
* best pros scoring advantage distribution: 40% approach, 28% driving, 17% short game and 15% putting
* long game (driving and approach) accounts for 60% of scoring differences

# Golf strategy
* green reading, distance control and accuracy are three main elements of putting
* amateurs often hit downhill putts too hard and uphill putts too soft
* learning from your first putt or putts of others is a great way to read the green
* the amount a putt breaks depends on a putt's angle to the fall line
* aim for a spot beyond the hole, closer on uphill putts, farther on downhill putts
* putts under 15 feet has to go past the hole
* downhill putts, sometimes miss goes 3 or 4 feet past the hole
* long putts, stop as close the hole as possible, no matter if short
* uphills putts are easier than downhill putts
* 3-7 feet putts is the range that separates good from average putters

# tee-to-green strategy
* strategy depends on shot pattern and the features of the golf hole, maximize the chance of success
* tee-shots that land in rough cost 0.1 - 0.25 stroke
* shots into recovery situation cost 0.5 stroke
* shots into water cost 1 stroke
* shots OOB cost 2 strokes
* the bigger the penalty, the farther away you should aim
* conservative strategy is not always the optimal strategy
* on average, closer to the hole scores better than laying up on 80 or 100 yards

# golf games
* reduce number of awful shots is the single easiest way of shaving strokes off your scorecard
* practice with a purpose

## 10 foot 10 point game
* count how many holes you putted before you reached 10 points
* 2 points if you sink the putt
* -1 if you leave the first one short
* 0 for two putt
* -3 if you 3-putted or more

## variation for 5-, 10- and 15- putting games

| Golfer        | 5-foot/15 pts | 10-foot/10 pts | 15-foot/5 pts  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|

| avg tour      | 10  |   14 |14 |

## The spiral game


## 19th hole
* important shots are those that lead to coring difference, more putts in a round doesn't mean putting is more important than driving
* between 2004 and 2012 contributed putting to 35% of victories (putting contribution to victory)
* when a golfer wins, putting contribution is 35%, when top golfer plays well, it is only (15%)
* no matter who you are (pro, amateur, poor amateur), putting contributes 15%, tee-to-green shots 85%
