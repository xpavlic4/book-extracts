# Elements of Scoring
Scorer - someone who gets consistently the most of his skill level.

Top 10 mistakes amateurs make:
* underclubbing
* swinging too hard
* shooting at the flag
* not playing away of trouble
* missing the green on the wrong side
* trying too much out of trouble
* trying to pull up shots they never practiced
* panicking in the sand
* misreading turf and lie condition
* underreading the break of the putt

Two basic principles: play comfortable and avoid big mistakes

## Knowing your game
Measure your carry distances.
Solid contact is key measure of how good striker you are.
Know you shot pattern and your usual miss.
