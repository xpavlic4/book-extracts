# The Art of Mental Training

Whatever is going on inside your head has everything to do with how well you end up performing.

No matter what your game is, or what the challenge is, the difference between great performances and average performances is mostly mental.

## On the Importance of Positive Attitude

Good attitude, a positive attitude creates optimism, positive energy. Working on keeping a positive attitude is what will help you work through bad patch. A positive attitude helps create the opportunity for a great comeback or for a great performance. A positive attitude never works against you. But a negative attitude will always find a way to work against you.

Never beat yourself up after a loss - there is always something positive to be gained, something to be learned, even from a negative situation.

Mental control starts with a decision.

The Champion understands that a bad attitude can cost him everything. It affects not only how you feel, but also how you perform.

## Gaining the Mental Edge

One must consistently practice mental skills and routines in order to tap one's full potential.

# How to react when the pressure is on

Don't rush when the pressure is on - smooth is fast. Breath, pause, and learn to gather yourself. But never, ever, allow yourself to rush your game.
Stay task-focused. Interrupt negative self-talk and images the moment they arise, shut them down on the spot. Replace them with positive self-talk and positive images. Concentrate on showing your brain exactly what it is that you want to achieve, never dwell on what you do not want to happen.

## The Importance of self-believe

It's self-belief that gets everything going.

# How to disable conscious mind acting

It is only when we are in a deep state of relaxation that the conscious mind quits acting as a filter for the inner mind.

## Controlling anger

It always starts with a choice to not let it control you. Use focused breathing to help manage the intensity. Internal self-talk like: Stay cool, calm down.

If anger arises, make the decision to not let it control you. Use techniques to redirect energy. Use the energy to resolve.

## Active when controlling

You must choose to control anger through a decision. For if you lose control to anger - then the anger will surely control you.

## On Loosing and Response on it

Champions focus on what they can control. They know that while they can't always control what takes place during an event, they can always control how they respond to an event. Within every setback lies the hidden opportunity for a great comeback.

## Fear of Failure

Being afraid to fail actually helps create the conditions that make failure more likely. Fear of failure is caused by not knowing how to fail constructively. The only way to accomplish anything great is to risk failing at it first. If you have a fear of failing, it is more than just a bad thing. It can actually cripple your changes of success.

## Controlling Fear

Fear can turn a competitor from someone trying to win, into someone trying not to lose. Against fear, one can always win. Confront the fear and then engage a strategy to move forward despite the fear.

## On Performance Choking

Momentarily pick a focus point in your immediate environment and fix your eyes on it as you continue your focus breathing. This will help shift the focus away from yourself and to refocus on the particular task at hand. Performance choking is caused by an ego that is afraid of looking bad. You must learn to leave your ego outside of your event.

## Cool under pressure

Many champions have personal affirmations. (I am good, I am fast, I am the best). What they may be doesn't matter as long as they help you take the pressure off yourself. Create three quick affirmations (positive statements) you can fire off to yourself to complement the breathing and relaxation techniques mentioned above. Another method to deal with the pressure is simply thinking about something that relaxes them (e.g. listening to the music). Some athletes talk about having experienced their greatest moment in sports through releasing themselves from any fear of failure. Noticing the things that helped you deal with pressure in the past can make it possible for you to access those techniques again.

## The power of positive talk

When things are tough, it is most important to listen only for the positive self-talk of a champion who is focused on working his way through adversity. Shut down the Internal Critic.

## Too intense

A good mental athlete learns early on at what level of intensity he plays his best game. On a scale of one to ten (ten being at the most intense level) most top athletes report that they perform best at around levels seven or eight.

## the dreams

What is your dream? Figure it out. That is your assignment.

# On Goals
When an athlete complains of lacking motivation, you can be sure that it's almost always caused by goals that fail to inspire him to action. Goals serve to keep you on target.

While setting your own, private goals, be sure that they are both challenging and realistic. Slightly out-of-reach goals are best: inspiring hard work, yet still attainable with dedicated effort. Goals need to be set neither too high nor too easy and low - which would defeat their very purpose. Goals should be written down and reviewed frequently. Goals should come in the forms of daily goals, monthly goals and annual goals, and remember that what you are striving for is progress rather than perfection. Believe me, as you begin to focus on meaningful, specific goals, the power of your hidden reserves will be unleashed and good things will begin to happen.

Ask yourself what you want to accomplish over the next two or three years. Make these your long-term goals. Give them a completion date. Than think of at least three things that you want to achieve within the next year. Make these your short-term goals. Then decide what it is that you can do every month to help you accomplish your short-term goals. Write these down. These are you monthly goals. Give them a completion date too. Set daily goals, that help you achieve monthly goals, that help you achieve your short-term goals, which in turn help you achieve your long-term goals.

Take action. Everything you need is inside of you, inside your very dreams. Goal represents your dreams along a time-line, showing you the steps needed to achieve your success.

## Do the work

Once you really make the commitment to work hard at becoming a champion, something powerful is set in motion - heart power.

## The work being done

Successful people have the self-discipline to do the things that have to be done, whether they enjoy them or not.

## Changing your mental state

I am strong, I am fast, I dominate. I control the match, I never give in, I never give up, I am powerful, I beat my opponent, I am an unchained lethal gladiator, I conquer. I am an unstoppable champion, a force of fury, my opponent submits. Use all critical elements and bring them together in order to change your state completely - The Self-talk of a Champion preparing to do battle, the Body Movements of a Champion preparing to do battle, and the Breathing of a Champion preparing to do battle. Than, allow yourself to become that Champion as you enter your competition.

## The present

The two skills the Warrior/Champion must process to help him reach his maximum potential are the ability to recognize when his mind is not focused on the present, and the ability to bring it back into the present. When your mind is racing, help bring it back by focusing on your breathing. This will help you to reach that place where we have a sure sense that we can do what we know we need to do, and that we can do it without having to try too hard, a place from where technique flows freely and accurately, a place from which right action springs forth. TLDR quiet the mind. Be totally in the Present

## Prepare to win

You must trust yourself. There must be no lack of commitment in your mind. Eliminate doubt. There is no room for it. Have confidence and trust yourself as you prepare to win. Always take your training sessions seriously. Always concentrate.

## Walk on

The past is gone my friend. You can look back on it but it is only a reflection. The future lies ahead... but it is a future that has not yet been realized. So in reality, today is all we have. And today is here. Why don't you just start walking on your new path, one step at a time? Conjure up some new dreams, cast them out to the Universe, keep your head up, have faith, and discover what lies ahead. Life itself has put you on this path. Just trust what is and be with it.
