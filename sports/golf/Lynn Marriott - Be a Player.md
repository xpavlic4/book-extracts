# Master human skills
Pillars of golfer's game:
* fitness level
* technical skills
* equipment
* human skills

but only the human skills can change during the play, all other is set.

# Awareness
Golfers have specific tendencies, recurring patterns when playing well and when they don't play well.

* physical awareness
* mental Awareness
    * shot selection
    * course strategy
    * every cognitive thought

The highest level of execution, whether by a pianist, golfer, dancer is controlled by the right or sensory part of the brain, and is characterized by a shift away from the conscious brain to the subconscious brain- the zone or flow.
The present is all there is in golf. There is nothing else. The more you can figure out how to get yourself to the present during your round, the better you will play. The fun part for each player is to find out his own path to the present.

Questions:
- person outwardly aware or inwardly
- mind is focused or scattered
- emotions are calm, excited, nervous, worried or confident

# Variability
Human skills are what you can truly control on the golf course.

Questions:
* how do you handle slow play?
* how do you react to fast play?
* unlucky bounces or bad lies?
* how do you feel when you start off your round well or bad
* how do you perform with different kinds of players
* how do you perform with different types of courses
* how do you manage changes in your body, mind and emotions during your round.

On-Course explorations:
* hit shot you would not normally hit with that club, but stay committed
* pick something what distracts you and hit the shot
* play speed golf, run between shots, shortest routine
* take time between shots and routine, play extra slow
* play from different tee box
* tee off with with conservative strategy where you would normally hit the driver
* play shots and give yourself bad lies every time
* play with a feeling of being tight, what shots you are struggling with
* play a hot and do lumber-jacks before every shot (adrenaline in your blood)

# Balance, tempo and tension
## Balance
If you take off your shoes and swing barefoot, you will more clearly sense whether your weight is on the balls of your feet.
Also hit balls with feet together, on one foot or with eyes closed.
## Tempo
By practicing and hitting the ball with different tempos - from 20 to your normal speed.
Practicing speed variations will allow you to master hitting very fast form thick rough or soft for a flop shot.
Sometimes hitting slower tempo corrects sequencing hence you hit further.
## Tension
grip pressure, tension in your body
Questions:
- hit 5 shots with your feet together and stay balanced
- hit 3 shots standing on the right foot, 3 shots on the left foot. Can you finish in balance?
- make full swing slow, medium and fast tempo, how it feels?
- different grip pressure, how it feels?

on-course explorations, play one hole with following:
- hit shots with feet together
- hit shots with 50% tempo
- one hole focus on shoulders relaxed
- concentrate where your balance is
- hit shots wit 75% tempo
- focus on grip pressure
- hit shots with your eyes closed
- make practice swings on one foot only
- smile all the way

# during the round

* Think Box - where decisions are made
* Play Box - where the shot is executed
* Memory Box - where positive is stored and negative is transformed into neutral

## Play Box
something you have to feel during your whole swing. E.g. grip pressure, tempo etc.

Questions:
* How well can you keep a Play Box sensation until the very end of your swing?
* How deeply can you focus in your Play Box?

on-course explorations, play one hole with following:
- see the ball flight or the target it your mind
- feel constant grip pressure or softness in shoulders
- listen to the sound of the impact or hum a song
- choose Play Box awareness and hold it until the ball comes to rest
- close eyes and experience a Play Box feel before stepping into the shot
- play with play box sensation of feeling free and athletic during each swing
- feel 100 % connection to your target
- feel different Play Box sensation for the back-swing and different for the downswing
- try to exaggerate your Play Box before each swing

## Think Box
- choose the shot
- commit your sensory state that will be used in the Play box
- present to that sensory state in PB

Do not take too much information in the Think Box.

Questions:
 - simplify your decision-making in your think box
 - when you choose a e.g. 7 iron, what will you do to clarify the sense of feel
 - how do you know your gut agrees
 - what's the purpose of the practice swing
 - does it make any change if you say your decision loud?
 - how is your body language when you make the decision
 - what is your transition action to "being" mode

 on-course:
 - play only with instinct and guts
 - use extra confident body language
 - close your eyes before stepping into the Play Box
 - use strongest voice to state your decision
 - create high adrenaline before hitting the shot
 - take two deep exhales before hitting your shots
 - create a happy feeling in your heart
 - ask yourself a question, "do I trust my decision?" and say YES
 - see the future before stepping into your shot
