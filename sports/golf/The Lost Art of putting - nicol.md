# Introduction
To be childlike is to have a simple fascination in getting the ball into the hole and to love the task of doing so. To be childish is to expect a certain outcome will come your way, that you 'deserve'to hole the putt or that you shouldn't miss from a certain distance.

## Key takeaways
1. If you change your perspective and concepts around putting this will have the potential to liberate you on the greens to experience what you are truly capable of.
2. The biggest and most lasting golfing improvements are made through adopting and applying a different mental outlook and approach, rather than trying to master or perfect physical skills or movements.
3. When you believe deep down about your putting will manifest itself into a self-imposed reality. You become the story you tell yourself the most often. 
4. If we are able to better judge the pace of a putt, that little white ball will find its way more often into what we will explain as actually being a bigger hole.
5. Imagine being excited to walk on to a green with a sense of what yo could do as opposed to being concerned about what might go wrong.

# Chapter 1: What is your story?
What the thinker thinks the prover proves. So if we thinkg we are poor on the greens then the 'prover'inside our minds will seek supporting evidence of that thought.

## Key takeaways
1. A missed putt in and of itselft means nothing beyond the meaning we personally attach to it.
2. Poor putters indulge in a 'pity party'of all the putts they have missed. These stories become our reality. If we tell ourselves a story enogh times we actually become the story.
3. Can you  begin to see how your own narrative of your putting capability has such a long-term effect on your performance?
4. Consider how much the putting story you have carried around with you for so long might have held you back. Do you want to keep with the same old story or could it perhaps be the time to take charge of a new script?
5. You can keep the existing story or you can decide to change them. The choice is yours. You can choose to allow someone else to write it for you or you can choose to write your own story.

# Chapter 2: Attention
Just imagine now if you made a commitment as you walk up to the green you simply place your attention on your breath.

Putts are missed because your head is jumping from one topic to another and you are not concentrating on anything.
When you approach the green set your attention for the next putt.
Use breathing through your nose for calming down.

## Exercise 1: Attention on the breath
Breathe in and out with your nose. Don't try to change anything. If your attention drifts to other things bring it back to the rise and fall of your breath.

## Exercise 2: The Walk
Once you hit your approach shot, concentrate on your breathing until you step on the green.

## Exercise 3: The after-image
Practice using retinal after-image. Look at the ball at address and after the impact look at the spot where the ball was.
