# Chapter 2
Putts are missed because your head is jumping from one topic to another and you are not concentrating on anything.
When you approach the green set your attention for the next putt.
Use breathing through your nose for calming down.
Practice using retinal after-image. Look at the ball at address and after the impact look at the spot where the ball was.
