# How to become a better putter
# Breaking putts
* if you are linear, ie. better suited to aim at straight line, try to visualize the aimline
* if you are non-linear visualise the curve
* hit number of putts aiming at the coin at the end of aimline and number of putts through the gate on a curve. decide what works better for
* big difference in start lines between a dead weight and a three-foot past putt
* a downhill putt takes much longer to reach the hole

# Common myths and Misconceptions in putting
* myth: you have to accelerate, drill: position two balls and try to have backswing (1 unit of time) and forward-swing (from back all the way to forward) also in 1 unit of time
* myth: low and slow
* myth: putter straight back and through
* use face-balanced putter if you miss left (you have to try it)
* myth: green speed vs putter weight, it can influence, but you still have to try it
* many golfers feel comfortable lifting toe
* drill to train your speed: 3 fake holes along the line 1 foot apart all on line, try to roll 1st putt to land on the last hole, 2nd putt on the second and the 3rd one to land dead on the 1st hole
* speed control is about adaptability, not about hitting the same distance again and again
* many good players are not parallel aligned, are more open

# Pull bias (miss left)
* players are way too close
* players have head or body open
* sometimes looking at the part of the putter gives you perception of being squared
* the stroke works on an arc, not straight back and straight forward, also don't try to disconnect your arms from body
* have symmetry in how your torso goes back and forward (see yourself in a mirror and try to minimise any asymmetry)
* right arm position is key when producing pull (do not rotate your forearm internally)
* generate your power using your torso
* have passive wrist action during your backswing
* check your body alignment using a mirror, maybe your shoulder are aiming left

# Push bias by Phil Kenyon (miss right)
 * Push/Pull bias test - 10 feet putt, putt two balls 14 inches (36 cm) from the ball, 55 mm
## Push bias
* if you push, try to have a stance more to the right and closer to the ball
## Understanding your putter
* use putting mirror and try things out
## The Killer Concept
* string over the the whole path
* torso, hands and arm work as a unit
## Setup and stroke mechanics
* be aware of forward press can change the putter head aim
## Lead Arm Mechanics during the Backswing
* lead arm internally rotate (for someone who pushes)
## Lead Arm Mechanics in the Follow-Through
* tuck a glove under your leading arm-pit
## Strike position
* have two balls just the with of putter apart
* place a ball in the middle and hit it
* this should give you more awareness of where the center of the putter is

## Torso motion
* keep your head nice and steady when doing the stroke

## Wrist mechanics
* stick tee peg

# Putting fundamentals by Phil Kenyon
## Introduction
* good accuracy is within 1%, it's the width of the hole from 10 feet
## Managing break
## Managing direction
* line a ruler on the floor that points direct at the hole, now step over the putt and see where the ruler is actually pointing to. try to increase distance from the ball, neck bend and neck tilt to the line straight
* once you hove found your ideal head position, what are the correct visuals to look at on your putter
* my tendency is to tilt my head to my right ear to see the line straight

## Tempo drill
* two pegs on the green to mark your backswing and follow-through
* keep the tempo and rhythm the same, the length of the swing is different for different distances
* try hit a ball, now repeat the tempo and try to hit it past 3 feet

## Green reading
* clockface drill, 6 o'clock is uphill putt, 12 o'clock is downhill, 3 o'clock is RtoL break

## Break prediction
* use feet to feel the tilt of the green
* if you face a 10 feet putt, circle the hole in a 10 feet distance to feel where is uphill and where is break (clock)
