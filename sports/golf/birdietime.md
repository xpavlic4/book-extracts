# Putting fundamentals by Phil Kenyon
## Introduction
* good accuracy is within 1%, it's the width of the hole from 10 feet
## Managing break
## Managing direction
* line a ruler on the floor that points direct at the hole, now step over the putt and see where the ruler is actually pointing to. try to increase distance from the ball, neck bend and neck tilt to the line straight
* once you hove found your ideal head position, what are the correct visuals to look at on your putter
* my tendency is to tilt my head to my right ear to see the line straight

## Tempo drill
* two pegs on the green to mark your backswing and follow-through
* keep the tempo and rhythm the same, the length of the swing is different for different distances
* try hit a ball, now repeat the tempo and try to hit it past 3 feet

## Green reading
* clockface drill, 6 o'clock is uphill putt, 12 o'clock is downhill, 3 o'clock is RtoL break

## Break prediction
* use feet to feel the tilt of the green
* if you face a 10 feet putt, circle the hole in a 10 feet distance to feel where is uphill and where is break (clock)
