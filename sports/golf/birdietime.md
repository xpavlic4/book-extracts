# Pull bias
* players are way too close
* players have head or body open 

# Push bias by Phil Kenyon
## Push/Pull bias test
 * 10 feet putt, putt two balls 14 inches (36 cm) from the ball, 55 mm
## Push bias
* if you push, try to have a stance more to the right and closer to the ball
## Understanding your putter
* use putting mirror and try things out
## The Killer Concept
* string over the the whole path
* torso, hands and arm work as a unit
## Setup and stroke mechanics
* be aware of forward press can change the putter head aim
## Lead Arm Mechanics during the Backswing
* lead arm internally rotate (for someone who pushes)
## Lead Arm Mechanics in the Follow-Through
* tuck a glove under your leading arm-pit
## Strike position
* have two balls just the with of putter apart
* place a ball in the middle and hit it
* this should give you more awareness of where the center of the putter is

## Torso motion
* keep your head nice and steady when doing the stroke

## Wrist mechanics
* stick tee peg

# Putting fundamentals by Phil Kenyon
## Introduction
* good accuracy is within 1%, it's the width of the hole from 10 feet
## Managing break
## Managing direction
* line a ruler on the floor that points direct at the hole, now step over the putt and see where the ruler is actually pointing to. try to increase distance from the ball, neck bend and neck tilt to the line straight
* once you hove found your ideal head position, what are the correct visuals to look at on your putter
* my tendency is to tilt my head to my right ear to see the line straight

## Tempo drill
* two pegs on the green to mark your backswing and follow-through
* keep the tempo and rhythm the same, the length of the swing is different for different distances
* try hit a ball, now repeat the tempo and try to hit it past 3 feet

## Green reading
* clockface drill, 6 o'clock is uphill putt, 12 o'clock is downhill, 3 o'clock is RtoL break

## Break prediction
* use feet to feel the tilt of the green
* if you face a 10 feet putt, circle the hole in a 10 feet distance to feel where is uphill and where is break (clock)
