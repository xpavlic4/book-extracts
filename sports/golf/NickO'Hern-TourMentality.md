# Mental principles
Stay in the present, commit to the process. Don't think about future birdies/pars. Always commit to the very next thing to do.

## Pre-Shot Routine (PSR)
Should bring you into best possible state mentally and physically to execute a quality golf shot.
PSR has three distinct phases:
* Decide (D)
* Execute (E)
* Accept (A)

D is logical phase, gathering information and deciding what to do. Take wind, uphill, hazards into consideration. E is reacting phase. You trust your decision. You visualize the shot. You see the flight, where it lands.

The E phase to the PSR is a reaction to the shot in front of you. You have the information, you react.

Accept phase (A), accept whatever happens after you have hit the ball. You are OK with whatever happens. The only thing you can control while playing the game is what you do up until the ball leaves the clubface.

## Precise Target
"Aim small, miss small". Golf is *NOT* about the quality of your good shots, it is about the quality of you *BAD* ones.

## Switching on and off
Concentration for 4 or more hours is almost impossible. Break the round up into 72 (if you shoot par) bursts of focus rather than let's say 10 longer periods. Switch off the mind after you hit the shot and swith it back on before you hit your next one. Have a physical cue to swith into both modes, e.g. taking your glove off/on.

When you hit the shot, and undo the glove it is the hint to switch off. Also try meditation when walking the fairway. When 20 meters from the ball you should put the glove on again and that triggers the ON mode. Or use narrow and wide focus. Wide focus is thinking about the whole golf course, architecture etc. Narrow focus is about the green, fairway etc.

# Golf Course Mental Principles
What do I have to do right now?
* Stay in the present, commit to the process
* Pre-shot routine (PSR):
 - Decide: gather information
 - Execute: See your shot and commit
* Accept: let the results take care of themselves
* precise target: aim small, miss small
* switch on and off: glove

# Swing thoughts
For the average golfer and pro alike, having only one thought is essential for playing well.
Focus on you pre-shot routine only. The tempo is the number-one contributor to good putting on the golf course.

# Before a tournament
* wake up fresh
* no alcohol the night before
* drive slower to the couse as usual

# Game day
## Range 20 minutes
* range is for finding a good rhythm
* hit balls for 20 minutes (wedge, 7i, 3i and driver)
* hit 6i with full pre-shot routine on specific target
* final swing on the range is tee-shot on the first hole

## Short game area 10 minutes
* some chips
* bunker shots

# Grinders
Grinder is someone who do not have his best game for the day, but he is patient and get the most out of the day he have. Grinders remain in the present, go through you process as each shot presents itself, and not worry about the sate of your game.

# Awareness of negatives
Start a round of golf and put a handful (20 or more) tees in you left pocket. Every time you have a negative thought, take a tee out and put it in your right pocket. See how many holes you go before your left pocket is empty.

Use negatives as cue to give your mind focus and get back into the present mode.

# Match play
If you fall behind to your oponent early, it is important not to try and push things. Be patient and play your game.
Look at the oponent, if his head is down and feet is draging, you have to grind out every hole.
Once you are ahead, putt your foot down and keep trying to increase your lead rather than defend it.
You can also consede a putt when the distance is more than 3-feet so that your opponent get the feeling you are generous today. And when the situation comes you let him play the putt. The shock of not giving the putt to him should play to your advantage.

# Strategy
Hit fairways, hit greens, have a good short game and play to your strenght.

# The little voice
Little voice is the inner voice when you do something hard and it suggests you compromises. E.g. getting early and little voice is telling you to sleep longer. It gives exceuses and justifies it.
If you beat the little voice in practice, it gives you the strenght to beat it in the competition. At every stage of your progress, you will be tested and it is how you respond that defines you as a person. your biggest opponent will be yourself and the little voice. embrace the challenge and see it as a moment to step up and work harder. at the end of the day if you can stand in front of the mirror and honestly say you gave it everything you had, you will have no regrets. more than likely you wll have succeeded too.

# How to practice
The game has two areas:
* full Swing
* wedges and in (putting, sand, chips, pitches)

You should spend 2:1 time in favour of wedges and in. Have a plan what to practice.

## advanced player (single digit hcp)
for an hour, divide it into thirds:
* 20 mins fundamentals
* 20 mins on skills
* 20 mins on competitive scenarios

During the fundamentals I am not too concerned about where the ball is going. Focus on the technical aspect of my swing.
Than try to hit various trajectories.
Three in a row drill - three shots in a row between two targets, e.g. 6i tp 170 yards that are 7 yards wide. if you fail one of those tree, you start again.

# Pre-shot routine

## Full swing
Stay behind the ball and visualize the entire shot, where it lands. Make 2 practice swings to replicate the type of shot you have just visualized. Look at the target, waggle, and start the trigger.

## Pitching and chipping
Visualize, see the entire path. Make two practice swings. focus on the rhythm. Be reactive and trust your instincs.

## Putting
take a quick look from behind the ball, and than walk to the *low* side of the putt. Than move behind the hole to see the putt around the hole. That's where the most brake is taking place. Go back to the ball. Aim 3 feet ahead. Now E phase starts. measure the putting rountine (around 11 seconds).

Now step into the ball:
1. look at the hole
2. look back to my putter
3. start the stroke

# Practice-Area drills
## Full Swing
### Three-in-a-row
Hit three shots between two targets. If you miss one you start again. E.g. drive between 30 yards wide target, 5i between 20 yards

### Seven out of ten
e.g. 8i between 10-15 yards, or 6-7 yards for advanced players

### One club
hit one club to various targets, experiment

## Short game
choose 5 locations around the green, e.g. bunker shot, a flop shot, bump-and-run, downhill/uphill chip. Take 3 balls from each location and try to get up&down every single time (for a PRO, 8/15 for an amateur).

## Par twos
play 3 balls around the green and use only one wedge. see in the ende which wedge won the most. this should teach you to use various shots and chips around the green.

## Putting

### Chalk line
find a straight putt about 5 feet long. use a string or chalk to mark line on the green. you get instant feedback whether you hit it straight or you just aimed incorrectly and justified it.

### leapfrog
one tee 15 feet from you, the other 24 feet from you. you hit 5 balls. each ball has to pass the first tee. second ball hast to past first ball but be short of the second tee. etc. the idea is to get 5 balls within two tees. every time you complete, start 3 feet further, ie. 18 feet, 21 feet. etc.

### NSEW

stands for north, south, east and west. putt balls at 3,6,9,12 and 15 feet in every direction. finish one direction before moving to the other. average player should make 10 out of 20 balls, andvanced 12/20

## golf course games

### half set
play with odd-number clubs (3,5,7,9)

### two ball best ball
play two balls and take only the better. it teaches you to play agressive and get you some confidence.

### two ball worst ball
teaches you to play strategically, methodically and limiting mistakes

### 5-irons and up
longest club you can use is 5i. teaches you more wedges

### three-club challenge
choose only 3 clubs and play golf. e.g. 5w, 6i and putter
