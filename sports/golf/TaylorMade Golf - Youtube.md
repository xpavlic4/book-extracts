# Tour Talks with Martin Kaymer
* he was -10 after Friday, leading the U.S. Open and his mindset was to beat himself again and be better even if it wasn't possible, because pin positions and the golf course setup was tougher as the day before
* do your work in the training and forget about it on the golf course
