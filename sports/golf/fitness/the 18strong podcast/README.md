Is this the right work? People are scared. Chase what scares you.

* See what is going on. Accept what is good and what is bad. See what are you capable of doing.
* Sacrify your time, good and bad sacrifices.
  * Good: comfort zone
  * Bad: relationships, health
* Sustain

Find the reason why you are on the train. It came accidently. Eg. I want to loose some weight. Now ask 7 more times why. Why do you want to loose some weight? To fit into the jeans. Why do you want to fit into the jeans? So my husband doesnt think I am fat. Why do you want your husband not think you are fat? It is threatening my relationship...

Time that ordinary people waste extraordinary leverage. If you say yes to something new you said no to something you have already said yes to. Try to block off time on calendar where you have white spots - nothing to do. And fill those with your goals.

# 125 interview with Scott Stallings

It is difficult to prove that working out won't help your game.

# 124 Perform under pressure

Mental management practice means every shot is perfect. When you practice, not every shot you would like to cement into your unconsciousness.

Perform better when in pressure or have fun in it.

You have to swing unconscious. Self-image, you have to like to hit the ball. You build your Self-image be either hitting the ball in real or mastering mental exercises. That's called mental management.

Knowledge without actions is hurting you, because it sets expectations you are not going to make. Stop trying and start training.

Habits - keeping up is better than catching up.

Victim mentality vs. Hero mentality - Sacrify your life, overweight vs be in shape and lead by examples (to your kids)

Do the thing you fear the most.

Comfortable emptiness - do not thing much and be yourself and you can perform at best. But you have to earn it through experiences.

When you lose or win no matter what you enjoy/cope with the feeling for 10 days, but 11th day you get to the normal life again. Otherwise you have big lows and big hight which is no good for you family life.

get up super eary 4:30, 2x-3x HIIT, drink water, drink, 30-40 minutes

# 110 Win or loses

Suzan Luci lost 19 consecutive times. Do not define success in big way, just steps how to get there. Failures are building block how to play.

# 122 Episode Mindset Manifesto

Reframe doubt - When I hear doubt but it is meaningless.

Capacity
 *  the same for every person

Capability
 * you are capable to do now

100% capacity, capability is always less. Concentrate on 80% you have instead of 20% you don't have.

## Habits of successful people

First things first. Do administrative tasks done or they cost you power.

Every day plans.

Review and reflect every evening. 10mins, 15 mins.
