I play my best golf when ...?
your worst golf when:
* high expectations
* stressed
* overthing

95% golfers have tension problem, not technique problem (it works on driving range)

number one rule in golf: keep the ball in play

on every hole, go to the forward tee or on every par4 and par5 throw the ball into the 100 meters and you see that you won't improve so much. Distance is not everything, the most important part is chipping and putting.

## 149 fueling for performance
Eat as much as possible the night before a tournament, and eat again 2 hours before a tournament. On the golf course eat buter, than nuts on 6/7 and 12/13 hole.

## 147 Andrew rice
use one club for every chiping

## 145 adam young
Chipping stations. They are difficult as you go further. Station one is a chip over a bag. Station two is chip over a bag and land on the green. You have two attempts. You fail both you go to the lower level. You make both you go up. You make just one you stay at the current level.

## 144 adam stevenson

Use breathing technique after bad/exelent holes.
Use gamification when practice. Different length shots, compete against each other (or yourself).

## 140 nutrician

* Step 1: types of food

Proteins – chicken, fish, beef, turkey, eggs, whey

Fats – nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado

Carbs – fruits, vegetables, oatmeal, rice, sweet potatoes

Once a client complies with this list for 90%+ of their feedings I move on to step 2.

* Step 2: how much food

There are a number of formulas for determining caloric intake factoring in age, gender, activity level, and so on. The vast majority of people overestimate calorie needs.

An easy starting point for calories per day:

Fat Loss – Body Weight X 10-12

Maintenance – Body Weight X 13-15

Muscle Gain – Body Weight X 16+

So a 200-pound man looking to maintain his body weight would eat 2600-3000 calories per day.
Eg. 97 kg (213 pounds), 213 * 12 = 2556

* Step 3: macronutrient ratios

A baseline that will work in most cases is 1/3 of calories from fat, 1/3 from protein, 1/3 carbs.

Adjust from there depending on the following:

Is your goal to gain muscle?

Is your goal to lose fat?

What is your body fat percentage?

How much muscle mass do you have?

In hours, how much high intensity training are you doing per week?

A lean & muscular athlete who trains 10 hours per week and is looking to add muscle mass will use a higher ratio of carbs. For example, 65% carbs, 25% protein, 10% fat.

A fatter weekend warrior working a desk job and training hard 3 hours per week will take in a lower ratio of carbs: 20% carbs, 40% protein, 40% fat.

## 128 Powe of Focus Henry Boulton

at the end of Analysis phase ask yourself a question - what would a good shot look like?

if you look at the ball, your awareness and your eyes are on the ball. Now if you look at the target, your eyes don't know where to go. So if you see the bunker you concentrate on the bunker. Whereas when you first move you awareness and than your eyes, than your eyes know where to go. Try it: look at the right right corner of your monitor and than move your eyes to the left corner. Now try to look at the right corner and move awareness to the left corner. And now try to move your eyes. Now see the difference. Your brain knows where to go.

Correct pre-shot routine: your eyes and awareness are on the target. Your awareness comes back to the ball, your eyes comes back to the ball and your awareness goes to the target and hit the ball.

Practice: Move awareness prior to eyes to different objects in your room.

Breatheing exercise: As you breathe in, your stomach goes out, as you breate out your stomach goes in.

## 126 Archieve anything with a lot of hustle with Anthony Trucks

Is this the right work? People are scared. Chase what scares you.

* See what is going on. Accept what is good and what is bad. See what are you capable of doing.
* Sacrify your time, good and bad sacrifices.
  * Good: comfort zone
  * Bad: relationships, health
* Sustain

Find the reason why you are on the train. It came accidently. Eg. I want to loose some weight. Now ask 7 more times why. Why do you want to loose some weight? To fit into the jeans. Why do you want to fit into the jeans? So my husband doesnt think I am fat. Why do you want your husband not think you are fat? It is threatening my relationship...

Time that ordinary people waste extraordinary leverage. If you say yes to something new you said no to something you have already said yes to. Try to block off time on calendar where you have white spots - nothing to do. And fill those with your goals.

## 125 interview with Scott Stallings

It is difficult to prove that working out won't help your game.

## 124 Perform under pressure

Mental management practice means every shot is perfect. When you practice, not every shot you would like to cement into your unconsciousness.

Perform better when in pressure or have fun in it.

You have to swing unconscious. Self-image, you have to like to hit the ball. You build your Self-image be either hitting the ball in real or mastering mental exercises. That's called mental management.

Knowledge without actions is hurting you, because it sets expectations you are not going to make. Stop trying and start training.

Habits - keeping up is better than catching up.

Victim mentality vs. Hero mentality - Sacrify your life, overweight vs be in shape and lead by examples (to your kids)

Do the thing you fear the most.

Comfortable emptiness - do not thing much and be yourself and you can perform at best. But you have to earn it through experiences.

When you lose or win no matter what you enjoy/cope with the feeling for 10 days, but 11th day you get to the normal life again. Otherwise you have big lows and big hight which is no good for you family life.

## 122 Episode Mindset Manifesto

Reframe doubt - When I hear doubt but it is meaningless.

Capacity
 *  the same for every person

Capability
 * you are capable to do now

100% capacity, capability is always less. Concentrate on 80% you have instead of 20% you don't have.

## Habits of successful people

First things first. Do administrative tasks done or they cost you power.

Every day plans.

Review and reflect every evening. 10mins, 15 mins.
