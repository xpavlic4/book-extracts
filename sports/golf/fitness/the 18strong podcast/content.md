# 122 Episode Mindset Manifesto

Reframe doubt - When I hear doubt but it is meaningless.

Capacity
 *  the same for every person

Capability
 * you are capable to do now

100% capacity, capability is always less. Concentrate on 80% you have instead of 20% you don't have.

## Habits of successful people

First things first. Do administrative tasks done or they cost you power.

Every day plans.

Review and reflect every evening. 10mins, 15 mins.
