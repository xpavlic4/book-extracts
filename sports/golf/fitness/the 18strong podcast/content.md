Do the thing you fear the most.

Comfortable emptiness - do not thing much and be yourself and you can perform at best. But you have to earn it through experiences.

When you lose or win no matter what you enjoy/cope with the feeling for 10 days, but 11th day you get to the normal life again. Otherwise you have big lows and big hight which is no good for you family life.

get up super eary 4:30, 2x-3x HIIT, drink water, drink, 30-40 minutes

Suzan Luci lost 19 consecutive times. Do not define success in big way, just steps how to get there. Failures are building block how to play.

# 122 Episode Mindset Manifesto

Reframe doubt - When I hear doubt but it is meaningless.

Capacity
 *  the same for every person

Capability
 * you are capable to do now

100% capacity, capability is always less. Concentrate on 80% you have instead of 20% you don't have.

## Habits of successful people

First things first. Do administrative tasks done or they cost you power.

Every day plans.

Review and reflect every evening. 10mins, 15 mins.
