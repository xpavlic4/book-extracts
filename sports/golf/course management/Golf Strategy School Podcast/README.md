## How to quiet your mind

If you have many swing thoughts during your swing, you are not concentrating on anything. You need to occupy your brain. Try humming. Or try counting down, 5 practice swing, 4 behind the ball, 3 addressing target etc.

## Stay on your plan
Do not follow a bad shot with a dumb one. Bogeys won't kill you, but doubles will.
