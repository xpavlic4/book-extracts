# Be a Player: A Breakthrough Approach to Playing Better ON the Golf Course, by Pia Nilsson

## Level of execution - conscious vs. subconscious
The highest level of execution, whether by a pianist, golfer is controlled by the right or sensory part of the brain, and is characterized by a shift away from the conscious brain to the subconscious brain.

## The present is ally
The present is all there is in golf. There is nothing else. The more you can figure out how to get yourself to the present during your round, the better you will play. The fun part for each player is to find his or her own path tho the present.

## Swinging barefoot
If you take off your shoes and swing barefoot, you will more clearly sense whether your weight is on the balls of your feet.

## Awareness vs awkward stance
heighten proprioceptive awareness by hitting with feet together, on one foot, or with eyes closed. Use those during wam up before a tournament round.

## Slower tempo vs sequencing
Slower tempo often corrects faulty sequencing. In some cases it delivers more distance. That's why learning awareness and experimenting on the course in the context of game is important.

## Dead fish vs. current
Only dead fish swim with the current. In order to break you have to do things differently. Step out of your comfort zone. Try things out.

## Jack Nicklaus putting routine
Before Jack would putt, he would visualize every revolution of the ball toward the hole. He would see it drop into the cup, and then visually reverse the ball's motion all the way back to his putterface. Jack wasn't having a debate about his line with himsellf. He was waiting for the picture of the shot to complete itself. He wouldn't step up to the ball until that picture was crystal clear.

## 3 things in the Think box
Three things you need to do in the Think box.
* select shot you are going to hit
* commit to the sensory state you will use in the Play box
* need to be present to that sensory sate you have chosen

## Good Enough Shots
Being positive to Good Enough shots is crucial to stay positive.

## positive outcome, neutral to process
positive to outcome and neutral to process. No negative memories

## exercises on the courses
* hips lock up - a few steps forward and backward with feet toes together, ankles wide, and than the same with feet like a duck
* glues not activated - squats
