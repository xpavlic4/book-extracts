# Kevin Kisner Fixes Weekend Golfer's Chipping Game
Butt of your grip and the center of your chest have to move at the same rate all the time.

Practice with one arm only.

Keep your elbow tucked on the side to help with the movement of your chest and pelvis through the ball.

Always tuck your body into your body on all chips.
