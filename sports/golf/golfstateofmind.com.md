## how to succeed at tournament golf
* the more you try the harder it becomes, concentrate on the process rather than on the score
* you are not a refloction of your score, golf and you are two separate parts of life
* ask "what did you learn" after your round instead of "what did you shoot"
* be optimistic, list things you did great after each round
* be aware of how you are talking to yourself during your rounds
* focus on what you can control (not how others play)
## Performance state
* being overly concerned about the result restricts you
* do not expect perfection, mistakes arise no matter what
* recover from mistakes fast
* avoid chatter, find the peace of your mind, be focused
* best players are optimists
* when you play poorly, try to remember how you feel when you played your best round
  * use breathing
  * slow down between shots
  * visualization
  * positive self-talk
  * post-shot routine
  * use shot library or positive comments
## Swing thoughts
* technical cues examples:
  - controlled high finish
  - wide takeaway
  - keep your height
* what are my tendencies when playing under pressure? Am I too fast
* swing tempo https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/total-game/id329937776?mt=8
* internal vs external focus, better is external  

## Competitive practice
* add time between shots in practice (at least 1 minute)
* develop a routine as a process that anchors you to the present moment
* stress management techniques are mainly breathing and course process (routine)
* more pressure (increase heart rate or add consequences like holing a bunker shot, holing 5x 5ft putt)

## Improve your game during winter
* calculate strokes gained
* set specific goals for 2019 and how to get to them
* start a golf specific fitness regime
* meditate, use Headspace or Insight app
* practice mindfulness, you accept you cannot control your thoughts and tension
 it's the resistance that causes the frustration and tension and ultimately magnifies that negative thought or emotion
* make gratitude a daily habit

Gamefying can help with long term acquisition and creates pressure which simulates more of how we feel on the course.
Every session should have a goal.
