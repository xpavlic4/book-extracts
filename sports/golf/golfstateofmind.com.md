## the benefits of mental rehearsal for golf
* 3% of processing power is consciously controlled, 97% unconsciously
* daily 20 minutes before sleep
  - start meditate, silence the inner chatter
  - identify what you want to change - eg. confidence over short putts, closing out a win
  - now visualize with all senses
  - find key words you can identify with new behaviour eg. stick to the process

## how to succeed at tournament golf
* the more you try the harder it becomes, concentrate on the process rather than on the score
* you are not a refloction of your score, golf and you are two separate parts of life
* ask "what did you learn" after your round instead of "what did you shoot"
* be optimistic, list things you did great after each round
* be aware of how you are talking to yourself during your rounds
* focus on what you can control (not how others play)
## Performance state
* being overly concerned about the result restricts you
* do not expect perfection, mistakes arise no matter what
* recover from mistakes fast
* avoid chatter, find the peace of your mind, be focused
* best players are optimists
* when you play poorly, try to remember how you feel when you played your best round
  * use breathing
  * slow down between shots
  * visualization
  * positive self-talk
  * post-shot routine
  * use shot library or positive comments
## Swing thoughts
* technical cues examples:
  - controlled high finish
  - wide takeaway
  - keep your height
* what are my tendencies when playing under pressure? Am I too fast
* swing tempo https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/total-game/id329937776?mt=8
* internal vs external focus, better is external  

## Competitive practice
* add time between shots in practice (at least 1 minute)
* develop a routine as a process that anchors you to the present moment
* stress management techniques are mainly breathing and course process (routine)
* more pressure (increase heart rate or add consequences like holing a bunker shot, holing 5x 5ft putt)
