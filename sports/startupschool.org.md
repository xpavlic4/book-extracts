## How to evaluate a company
* Business = growth,
* your startup idea is a hypothesis. How do you prove it quickly
* Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Trigger
  To change a behaviour you need an idea (motivation), your startup (ability) and something that forces people to change their minds
* start with a problem from user view, do not use fancy tech (e.g. blockchain) just because it's new and you want to try it out
* ideal - market should grow 20% in a year

## How to plan an MVP
* launch quickly (even if it's bad)
* talk to customers and get a feedback
* iterate
* time your spec (I have 3 weeks to launch something)
* write your spec and cut it in half
