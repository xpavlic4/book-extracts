## Slow learners

By using persistence and flexibility, slow learners, can see things that geniuses miss.

## From passive to active learning
The best way to make sure you really know the material is to test yourself all the time. For example close the book or stop the video and actively work key problems yourself, or see if you can recall the key concepts without looking at the text. Talking with others or actively participate on forum is also very beneficial.

## The value of your past
Skills from one profession could be useful in another, completely unrelated profession.

## Focus and diffuse modes
Focus mode is when you are concentrating. Diffuse is when you are not thinking about anything in particular.
