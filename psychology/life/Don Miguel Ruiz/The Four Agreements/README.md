Everything is dream. The dream of the planet consists of dreams of us, people. Contains society's rules, belifs, laws, religions.

*Attention* is the ability to choose what to focus on. We agreed with the information that was passed to us from the dream. If we agree, we believe and that's faith - believe unconditionally.

Follow the rules - reward, break the rules - punished.
