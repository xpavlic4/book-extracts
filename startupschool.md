## How to Talk to Users
 The mom test
 * introduce your idea indirectly, use "my colleague has an idea" instead of "my idea is..."
 * you listen, customer talks
 * talk about life of your customer (extract the data from their life)

 Good questions to ask:
 * what's the hardest part when ....
 * tell me last time you encounter the problem
 * why was the problem hard
 * what have you done so far to solve this problem?
 * what don't you like about the solutions you have come up with?

 Users:
 * your co-workers, friends
 * yourself
 * just show up somewhere where the product will be used

 Tips:
 * take notes
 * keep it casual
 * keep it short (10-15 mins)
 * take phone number
 * discard compliments

Prototype stage is about choosing the first customers.
* how much does this problem cost them (money, energy)
* how often the problem arise
* how large is the budget for solving the problem

| Customer | ROI| Frequence | Budget|
| ---      | ---| --        |--|
|McDonalds | x  |           |   |
|Fancy rest |   |           |    |
|Google Cafe |  x|           |    |
