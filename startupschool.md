# Winter 2020
## How to Prioritize Your Time
* always work on things that have the highest KPI (revenue or active users)
* either talk to users or build the product
* fake progress (twitter activity, optimizing)
* 24 hours a day has to be allocated in family, exercise, friends, hobbies, sleep and startup
* list task and assess impact on weekly goal (high, medium, low) and complexity (easy, medium, hard) and always choose high impact with easy/medium complexity
* review weekly updates (low value work creep in)
* avoid switching between coding and meeting/talking to users


## How to evaluate a company
* Business = growth,
* your startup idea is a hypothesis. How do you prove it quickly
* Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger
  To change a behavior you need an idea (motivation), your startup (ability) and something that forces people to change their minds
* start with a problem from user view, do not use fancy tech (e.g. blockchain) just because it's new and you want to try it out
* ideal - market should grow 20% in a year

## How to plan an MVP
* launch quickly (even if it's bad)
* talk to customers and get a feedback
* iterate
* time your spec (I have 3 weeks to launch something)
* write your spec and cut it in half

## How to Talk to Users
 The mom test
 * introduce your idea indirectly, use "my colleague has an idea" instead of "my idea is..."
 * you listen, customer talks
 * talk about life of your customer (extract the data from their life)

 Good questions to ask:
 * what's the hardest part when ....
 * tell me last time you encounter the problem
 * why was the problem hard
 * what have you done so far to solve this problem?
 * what don't you like about the solutions you have come up with?

 Users:
 * your co-workers, friends
 * yourself
 * just show up somewhere where the product will be used

 Tips:
 * take notes
 * keep it casual
 * keep it short (10-15 mins)
 * take phone number
 * discard compliments

Prototype stage is about choosing the first customers.
* how much does this problem cost them (money, energy)
* how often the problem arise
* how large is the budget for solving the problem

| Customer | ROI| Frequence | Budget|
| ---      | ---| --        |--|
|McDonalds | x  |           |   |
|Fancy rest |   |           |    |
|Google Cafe |  x|           |    |
